During summer, in countries with high temperatures, distribution systems passing through forested areas are prone to wildfires. This paper proposes a stochastic programming approach for increasing resiliency of a distribution system exposed to an approaching wildfire. Dynamic line rating of the overhead lines is considered in order to model the impact of the wildfire on conductor temperature and flowing current. The uncertainties associated with solar radiation, wind speed, and wind direction that affect the progression of the wildfire and the production of stochastic distributed generators are taken into account. A scenario reduction algorithm is applied to reduce the number of scenarios in a tractable size and subsequently the computational burden. The proposed model is transformed to a mixed-integer problem with quadratic constraints, which provides effective solution to the operation of a distribution system against an approaching wildfire. A modified IEEE 33-bus distribution system is used to illustrate the applicability of the proposed approach.",1558-0679,,10.1109/TPWRS.2017.2733224,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7995099,Distribution system resilience;dynamic thermal rating;stochastic programming;wildfire,Fires;Conductors;Heating systems;Resilience;Energy storage;Power grids;Stochastic processes,,152.0,,38.0,IEEE,28-Jul-17,,,IEEE,IEEE Journals,[],['weather data'],[]
1,Multi-UAV Oxyrrhis Marina-Inspired Search and Dynamic Formation Control for Forest Firefighting,K. Harikumar; J. Senthilnath; S. Sundaram,"ST Engineering-NTU Corporate Laboratory, School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore; ST Engineering-NTU Corporate Laboratory, School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore; ST Engineering-NTU Corporate Laboratory, School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore",IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering,04-Apr-19,2019,16,2.0,863,873,"This paper presents an Oxyrrhis Marina-inspired search and dynamic formation control (OMS-DFC) framework for multi-unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) systems to efficiently search and neutralize a dynamic target (forest fire) in an unknown/uncertain environment. The OMS-DFC framework consists of two stages, viz., the target identification stage without communication between UAVs and the mitigation stage with restricted communication. In the first stage, each UAV adapts proposed OMS with three levels to select between Levy flight, Brownian search, and directionally driven Brownian (DDB) search for accurate target identification (“fire location”). The selection of each level is based on the available sensor information about the possible fire location. In the second stage, the UAVs that identified a fire location fly in a dynamic formation to quench the fire using water. The proposed formation is achieved through decentralized control, where a UAV computes the control action based on the fire profile and also the angular position and angular separation with its succeeding neighbor. The proposed formation control law guarantees asymptotic convergence to the desired time-varying angular position profile of UAVs based on the nature of fire spread (circular/elliptical). To evaluate the performance of the proposed OMS-DFC for the multi-UAV system, a search and fire quenching mission in a typical pine forest is simulated. A Monte Carlo simulation study is conducted to evaluate the average performance of the proposed OMS-DFC-based multi-UAV mission, and the results clearly highlight the advantages of the proposed OMS-DFC in forest firefighting. Note to Practitioners—Searching and mitigating dynamic targets like the forest fire is a challenging task due to the large area involved and also the time-varying nature of fire spread. The use of a cooperative multi-unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) system for searching targets in large area poses difficulties in maintaining persistent long distance communication between them. Moreover, the elliptical fire profile demands a time-varying angular displacement formation control of UAVs for effective fire mitigation. In this paper, we present a two-stage framework for search and mitigation of forest fire. The first stage provides a decentralized, noniterative stochastic search algorithm that requires no information sharing between the UAVs. The proposed search algorithm can be implemented without much computational efforts using a temperature measuring sensor and a thermal imaging sensor. The second stage provides a decentralized time-varying angular displacement formation control law efficient for tracking elliptical targets. The formation control law only assumes the availability of restricted UAV communication. The proposed formation control law can handle any targets that demand time-varying angular displacement formation for UAVs. The proposed algorithm is suitable for multi-UAV missions involving search and mitigation of dynamic targets distributed over a large area.",1558-3783,,10.1109/TASE.2018.2867614,ST-Engineering NTU Corporate Laboratory(grant numbers:CRP3-P2P);,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8474373,Decentralized search;forest firefighting;formation control;multi-unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) system;Oxyrrhis Marina-inspired search (OMS),Forestry;Heuristic algorithms;Temperature measurement;Vehicle dynamics;Target tracking;Task analysis;Fuels,,122.0,,39.0,IEEE,27-Sep-18,,,IEEE,IEEE Journals,['simulation'],"['weather data', 'fire data']",[]

In the prior-art grid resilience studies, the hurricanes or wildfires are mainly defended in terms of expected line damages, while they are prone to trigger short-circuit fault (SCF) evolved with dynamic influence in reality. In this paper, a fragile model is developed to evaluate the nodal SCF probability considering the insulation aging of equipment and extreme weather condition. Then, a response framework for extreme weather events is developed for a transmission system to defend the cascading impacts of expected SCFs. Specifically, switches are shifted to restrain the out-of-range short-circuit currents (SCCs) so that to ensure the SCFs can be removed by circuit breakers, generation rescheduling and load shedding are arranged to maintain the post-fault system transient stability. The above measures are optimized simultaneously by an integrated Mixed-Integer Nonlinear Programming (MINLP). Considering the error or uncertainty of weather event forecasts, a multi-state model is established to provide the most cost-effective grid resilience enhancement scheme, in which the expected urgent adaptions of the initial scheme subject to weather state transition is included in the overall cost.

In the past two decades, several algorithms utilizing data from Earth observation satellites have been developed to detect fire-affected areas. However, most of these methods require the establishment of complex functional relationships between numerous remote sensing data parameters. In contrast, more recently, deep learning has found its way into the application, having the advantage of being able to detect patterns in complex data by learning from examples automatically. In this article, a workflow for the detection of fire-affected areas from satellite imagery acquired in the visible, infrared, and microwave domains is described. Using this workflow, the fire detection potentials of four sources of freely available satellite imagery were investigated: the C-SAR instrument on board Sentinel-1, the multispectral instrument on board Sentinel-2, the sea and land surface temperature instrument on board Sentinel-3, and the MODIS instrument on board Terra and Aqua. For each of them, a single-input convolutional neural network based on the well-known U-Net architecture was trained on a newly created dataset. The performance of the resulting four single-instrument models was evaluated in presence of clouds and in clear conditions. In addition, the potential of combining predictions from pairs of single-instrument models was investigated. The results show that fusion of Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-3 data provides the best detection rate in clear conditions, whereas the fusion of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data shows a significant benefit in cloudy weather.",2151-1535,,10.1109/JSTARS.2021.3093625,Munich University of Applied Sciences and the German Research Foundation; ,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9468971,Data fusion;deep learning;remote sensing;wildfire detection,Instruments;Satellites;Sensors;Remote sensing;Clouds;Earth;Satellite broadcasting,,69.0,,43.0,CCBY,30-Jun-21,,,IEEE,IEEE Journals,"['machine learning', 'wireless sensor networks', 'remote sensing']",['weather data'],[]

Our prediction model enables fire rescuers to take appropriate measures to minimize damage caused by a wildfire based on its predicted scale in the fire's early stages. The modeling data were collected from the Canada National Fire Database (CNFDB) published by Natural Resources Canada, which includes wildfire and meteorological data for Alberta, Canada. The size of the burned area and the fire's duration were used to estimate the scale of a wildfire. After multi-collinearity testing and feature normalization, the data were divided into training and testing sets. Taking the meteorological factors as input values, a backpropagation neural network (BPNN), a recurrent neural network (RNN), and long short-term memory (LSTM) were implemented to establish prediction models.

By adjusting fire pixel selection criteria to include visible-light signatures, FILDA allows for significantly improved detection of pixels with smaller and/or cooler subpixel hotspots than the operational Interface Data Processing System (IDPS) algorithm. VIIRS scenes with near-coincident Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection (ASTER) overpasses are examined after applying the operational VIIRS fire product algorithm and including a modified “candidate fire pixel selection” approach from FILDA that lowers the 4-μm brightness temperature (BT) threshold but includes a minimum DNB radiance. FILDA is shown to be effective in detecting gas flares and characterizing fire lines during large forest fires (such as the Rim Fire in California and High Park fire in Colorado). Compared with the operational VIIRS fire algorithm for the study period, FILDA shows a large increase (up to 90%) in the number of detected fire pixels that can be verified with the finer resolution ASTER data (90 m). Part (30%) of this increase is likely due to a combined use of DNB and lower 4-μm BT thresholds for fire detection in FILDA. Although further studies are needed, quantitative use of the DNB to improve fire detection could lead to reduced response times to wildfires and better estimate of fire characteristics (smoldering and flaming) at night.",1558-0644,,10.1109/TGRS.2016.2566665,National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Suomi-NPP Program; Applied Science Program; Interdisciplinary Studies (IDS) Program; Radiation Sciences Program; NASA Nebraska Space Grant; ,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7498622,Day–night band (DNB);fire detection;fires;gas flares;Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS);visible light at night;wildfires,Satellites;Satellite broadcasting;NASA;Terrestrial atmosphere;Spatial resolution;Monitoring;Radiometry,,59.0,,76.0,IEEE,23-Jun-16,,,IEEE,IEEE Journals,['remote sensing'],['weather data'],['USA']

The demand for electrical energy is increasing due to the increase in the world population, the evolution of transport technology, and economic expansion, thereby resulting in overloading to the overhead line (OHL) system. In building new infrastructure for transmission lines, several issues need to be addressed. Thus, optimizing existing power by increasing the ampacity of power line is a practical solution to meet energy demand issues. During long-term operation, the temperature of OHL conductors may increase beyond their rated temperature, which is typically 75 °C for conventional conductors such as aluminum-conductor steel-reinforced cable. This condition is defined as thermal stress, which results in lower sag vertical clearance, tensile loss, elongation and creep, and reduced life span of the conductors. This condition must be avoided to ensure that the line is not permanently elongated, which can disrupt the vertical ground clearance, and to expand the conductor’s life. Other factors such as lightning, wildfire, aging, and degradation of the conductor can also cause thermal stress on the conductors and have thermal effects on the conductor’s performance. Therefore, unwanted thermal stress needs to be examined and identified by monitoring the thermal effect and behavior of the lines. This paper presents the state of the art in monitoring technologies that can be used to identify thermal stress on OHL conductors, including the issues and challenges in monitoring. At the end of this paper, a few suggestions are included to address the occurrence and assessment of thermal stress in lines.

In real-time operations, electric utilities have few options for wildfire risk mitigation, leading to use of disruptive measures such as proactive de-energization of equipment, frequently referred to as public safety power shut-offs. Such power shut-offs have significant impacts on customers, who experience power cuts in an attempt to protect them from fires. This work proposes the optimal power shut-off problem, an optimization model to support short-term operational decision making in the context of extreme wildfire risk. Specifically, the model optimizes grid operations to maximize the amount of power that can be delivered, while proactively minimizing the risk of wildfire ignitions by selectively de-energizing components in the grid. This is the first optimization model to consider how preventive wildfire risk measures impact both wildfire risk and power systems reliability at a short-term, operational time-frame.

Dynamic allocation coordinates the behavior of multiple UAVs through assignments to regions of fire based on a cost function that takes into consideration the fire locations relative to a UAV, distance to the domain edge, wind speed and direction, and the amount of suppressant already present. The use of receding horizons in the reactive synthesis formulation incorporates horizons defined only through spatial distance from a goal. Modifications to these horizon definitions guarantee that the scenario still maintains the overall realizability of the formal specifications after the inclusion of static obstacles. This paper shows the effectiveness of multiple UAV fleets in slowing down the progression of fires from reaching the domain edge through six fire scenarios. At last, our results and successful application demonstrate the utilization of reactive synthesis in larger task spaces and the implications of abstracting UAV transitions for use in formal methods.",2169-3536,,10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2885455,Lockheed Martin; ,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8568978,Reactive synthesis;receding horizon;temporal motion planning;distributed controllers;unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs);aerial fire suppression,Resource management;Aerospace electronics;Dynamic scheduling;Vehicle dynamics;Unmanned aerial vehicles;Aerodynamics;Task analysis,,27.0,,20.0,OAPA,07-Dec-18,,,IEEE,IEEE Journals,[],['weather data'],[]

In most operational smoke forecasting systems, fire emissions are assumed to remain constant during the duration of the weather forecast and are initialized using satellite observations. Recent work suggests that it may be possible to improve these models by predicting the temporal evolution of emissions. Here, we develop statistical models to predict fire activity one to five days into the future using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite fire counts and weather data from ERA-interim reanalysis.

However, before the establishment of industrial symbiosis, it is very crucial to monitor and predict the operational performance of the boiler used in the waste incineration plants. The existing works focus on using Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) for prediction of the performance of the boiler in terms of pressure, temperature, and mass flow rate of steam using the input parameters viz. feed water temperature, feed water pressure, incinerator exit temperature and conveyor speed. However, the problem with this approach is that shallow ANNs cannot model the complex mathematical non-linear relationships so precisely. In addition, ANNs are not interpretable which makes stakeholders apprehensive to use these networks in production. In this paper, we address these drawbacks of ANNs by modeling the complex relationship governing the boiler performance by using a set of machine learning and deep learning models. Also, the research paper introduces multiple techniques like feature importance, Partial Dependence Plots(PDP) plots etc. which interpret the reason behind the model's output to make it more reliable for the stakeholders. It has been empirically shown that the new Machine Learning and Deep Learning models performed better than the ANNs for predicting the boiler performance. The Random Forest model made a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 1.12 and LSTMs had a MAPE of 1.14 in the prediction of steam temperature Co which is a significant improvement in comparison to the original ANN model which had a MAPE of 6.93. In the case of the predictions for steam pressure kgf /cm2 the MAPE for the Random Forest model and LSTM was 5.54 and 4.21 respectively as compared to ANNs MAPE of 1.49. Similarly for steam mass flow rate(t/h), the MAPE was improved to 15.6 and 9.63 by Random Forest Model and LSTM respectively, which was originally 18.77 for ANN based model.

Power transmission lines passing through these areas are in particular vulnerable to wildfires. The heat generated by the fire can increase the surface temperature of the overhead conductors in its vicinity. Extreme surface temperatures can lead to conductor annealing and permanent loss of tensile strength. To avoid this, the thermal rating of the at-risk lines should be dynamically adjusted, so that reduced loading of the line counteract the heat gained from the fire. However, this can affect the flow of power and dispatch of the generation units. The goal of this paper is to analyze the impact of a wildfire on the operation of a power grid. Presence of wind has a major effect on the behavior of the fire and its impact on the line.

Gap breakdown in forest fire relates to many factors, such as flame temperature, conductivity and particles. Large quantities of smoke (carbon black) and flying ash are produced during the combustion of vegetation, causing the dielectric strength of gap to decrease drastically. In order to analyze the influence of forest fire particles on the breakdown characteristics of air gap, the experimental setup consisting of a conductor-plane was built to simulate the effect of forest fire particles. At the same time, a theoretical model was developed to analyze the influence mechanism of multiple particles on the discharge characteristics of gap. Experimental results show that, a chain of carbon particles has been formed between flame and conductor by the action of electric field. The gap's insulation strength decreases significantly, which is about 40% of that in the pure air under AC voltage. The particles movement and the breakdown characteristics of air gap have an evident effect of polarity characteristic under DC voltage and the breakdown voltage is reduced to about 29% of that in the air gap under negative DC voltage. The simulation results show that, the electric field distribution between conductor and plane become uneven, and the distortion degree of the elongated particle to the background electric field is not related to the distance between particles with high-voltage electrode.

The final result is the Fire Weather Index where we may see the four classes of fire danger rating in two-dimension map.

Every year the city of Quito is affected by recurrent forest fires, especially in summer time where high temperatures and soil dryness contribute to the propagation of fire in areas with vast vegetation. As a result to this problem, a WSN technological solution was created to address this problem which can detect forest fires in real-time sending alerts immediately to the end user. This prompt response helps to attenuate the impact of forest fires such as loss of human lives, loss of large areas of vegetation, economic loss and environmental contamination. The WSN prototype described in this document uses hardware, software, communication protocols, topology and functionality focused on optimizing its end results. The system is based on measuring continuously three types of gases, which are present in a combustion process such as CO2, CO and CH4. In addition to these sensors, environment temperature and humidity, as well as GPS location data is provided; this data is transmitted via wireless communications toward a graphical interface where the sensors data will be interpreted and statistical information can be generated.

However, such approach is not efficient in terms of exploration time since the mission execution and achievement in an unknown environment that needs a strong vehicle decision and control. Based on this observation, we improved the localization mission by a decision-based strategy resulting from a probabilistic model based on the temperature in order to estimate the distance towards the forest-fire.

The economic damage reported was nearly one billion Australian dollars and an estimated three billion native animals were killed or adversely affected. Given the extent and intensity of this damage, researchers are seeking effective solutions to enable the prediction of fire before it starts to increase the time available for firefighters to protect lives and assets and prepare to mitigate the fires. This motivated us to investigate an approach to address this critical problem. In this article, we propose a machine learning (ML)-based approach that detects anomalies in spatiotemporal measurements of environmental parameters (e.g., temperature, relative humidity, etc.). In the proposed approach, an ML-based model learns the normal spatiotemporal behavior of the environmental data (collected over a period of one year). This is carried out during a one-time training phase. Then, during the detection phase, any spatiotemporal pattern in the real-time data (received from the field sensors) that is different than the normal pattern will be identified by the model as anomaly which indicates a possible bushfire situation. Following this, we propose a supplementary classification model based on Moran’s I index to ensure that the detected anomalies are not due to either a sensor failure or a security attack (which are common in Internet of Things). We developed three different ML models for performance evaluation and comparison and used the Forest Fire data set to train them.

Monitoring wildfire propagation is thus a vital task in mitigating forest fires. While computational model-based wildfire prediction methods provide reasonable accuracy in monitoring wildfire behavior, they are often limited due to the lack of constant availability of real-time meteorological data. In contrast, social-media-driven drone sensing (SDS) is emerging as a new sensing paradigm that detects the early signs of forest fires from online social media feeds and drives the drones for reliable sensing. However, due to the scarcity of social media data in remote regions and limited flight times of drones, SDS solutions often underperform in large-scale forest fires. In this paper, we present CompDrone, a wildfire monitoring framework that exploits the collective strengths of computational wildfire modeling and SDS for reliable wildfire monitoring. Two critical challenges exist to integrate computational modeling and SDS together: i) limited availability of social signals in the regions of a forest fire; and ii) predicting the regions of fire where the drones should be dispatched to.

Poaching has a huge imbalance in the ecosystem, due to poaching many endangered species are now on the brink of extinction. A framework of IoT based Anti-poaching and Fire alarm System (IAFS) designed in this paper comprises of three sensors, i.e., temperature sensor, smoke sensor and Light Dependent Resistors (LDR) sensor. The proposed IoT based IAFS device consists of Arduino board which collects all the data from these sensors and relays the information to the cloud. The cloud platform continuously monitors the data and sends an alert notification via SMS to the forest officials whenever there is any intrusion detected. The aim of this proposed IAFS is to be able to remotely monitor forest cover and poaching of wild animals. Even with all the addition of extra manpower to curb the poaching activities and safeguard the forest, it is still inefficient owing to the large and dense forest area.

This work presents a MC sensing system comprising a nested split-ring resonator (NSRR) probe - a structure which has been demonstrated to be superior to the traditional SRRs in terms of its sensitivity and compactness - and an antenna to illuminate it. The NSRR is attached to the plant and the near-field interaction between the NSRR and the antenna produces an electromagnetically coupled system whose resonance frequency (fres) is modified by the water content of the medium loading the NSRR. Full-wave simulations are performed to model the system response for different tree species. Results of the experiments conducted in vitro and in vivo are presented. In the in vitro experiments, a freshly cut tree branch sample is allowed to dry at ambient temperature and its MC change is monitored by the system. The in vivo experiments prove that the sensing system can also capture the dynamic MC change of a plant. Calibration sets generated by curve-fitting of the variation of fres with respect to the MC and other sensing parameters are used to transform the measured fres to MC information. The results of the simulations and the experiments demonstrate that the proposed sensing system can be utilized as a non-destructive and wireless method for highly-sensitive characterization of the MC of trees and plants.",1558-1748,,10.1109/JSEN.2020.3043304,Technical University of Munich (TUM) Foundation; TUM University Foundation Fellowship (TUFF); ,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9286554,Moisture sensor;RF sensor;wireless passive sensor;nested split-ring resonator (NSRR);non-destructive method;in vitro experiments;in vivo experiments;forest fire prevention,Sensors;Wireless sensor networks;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Wireless communication;Vegetation;Sensor systems;Strips,,10.0,,38.0,IEEE,08-Dec-20,,,IEEE,IEEE Journals,['simulation'],['weather data'],[]

However, the dried-up and degraded peatland becomes extremely easy to burn, and in case of fire, it will further release transboundary haze. In order to protect the peatland, an improved tropical peatland fire weather index (FWI) system is proposed by combining the ground water level (GWL) with the drought code (DC). In this paper, LoRa based IoT system for peatland management and detection was deployed in Raja Musa Forest Reserve (RMFR) in Kuala Selangor, Malaysia. Then, feasibility of data collection by the IoT system was verified by comparing the correlation between the data obtained by the IoT system and the data from Malaysian Meteorological Department (METMalaysia). An improved model was proposed to apply the ground water level (GWL) for Fire Weather Index (FWI) formulation in Fire Danger Rating System (FDRS). Specifically, Drought Code (DC) is formulated using GWL, instead of temperature and rain in the existing model. From the GWL aggregated from the IoT system, the parameter is predicted using machine learning based on a neural network. The results show that the data monitored by the IoT system has a high correlation of 0.8 with the data released by METMalaysia, and the Mean Squared Error (MSE) between the predicted and real values of the ground water level of the two sensor nodes deployed through neural network machine learning are 0.43 and 12.7 respectively.

Therefore, the tree trunk effect was analyzed in this article using a thermal radiation directionality model, in which the forest structure was considered by the geometric optical (GO) theory and the spectral invariance theory was introduced into the GO framework for the single-scattering effect between components. The model used was evaluated using unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based measurements with root-mean-square errors (RMSEs) lower than 0.25 °C for directional anisotropies (DAs) of brightness temperatures (BTs). Comparison with a 3-D radiative transfer model, discrete anisotropic radiative transfer (DART), also indicated an acceptable tool of the proposed model for the trunk effect with RMSEs lower than 0.003 °C and 1.2 °C for DAs of emissivity and BTs, respectively. In this study, the root-mean-squared difference (RMSD) levels between the vegetation-soil and vegetation-trunk-soil canopies, which were viewed as an equivalent indicator of the trunk effect, were provided for the TOC emissivity and BTs as well as their DAs, by combination with the changes in the leaf area index (LAI), stand density, trunk shape, and component temperatures, which can help identify the cases in which the trunk effect should be considered. According to a comprehensive analysis, for cases with sparse stand density ( α <; 0.04), the tree trunk should be considered for a BT RMSD level lower than 0.5 °C when the LAI value was lower than 0.6. The corresponding LAI value was 0.8 for an RMSD level of BT DA lower than 0.3 °C. Moreover, for the cases with low soil emissivity, the difference in the TOC emissivity with and without trunk can reach up to 0.035, and the RMSD was still larger than 0.01 when the stand density and LAI were 0.05 and 0.6, respectively.",1558-0644,,10.1109/TGRS.2020.3011157,"Chinese Natural Science Foundation Project(grant numbers:41671366,41901287,41930111,41871258); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(grant numbers:BX20190364,2019M650037); National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2018YFA0605503); Youth Innovation Promotion Association CAS(grant numbers:2020127); “Future Star” Talent Plan of the Aerospace Information Research Institute of Chinese Academy of Sciences(grant numbers:Y920570Z1F);",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9157999,Directional anisotropy (DA);emissivity;forest;land surface temperature (LST);tree trunk effect,Vegetation;Forestry;Vegetation mapping;Soil;Land surface temperature;Temperature measurement;Temperature sensors,,8.0,,45.0,IEEE,04-Aug-20,,,IEEE,IEEE Journals,[],['weather data'],[]

Evaluation of satellite derived SM retrievals in boreal ecoregions is hindered by available in situ SM observation networks. To address this, an SM monitoring network was established in a boreal forest region in Saskatchewan, Canada. The network is unique as there are no other SM network of similar size in the boreal forest. The network consisted of 17 SM stations within a single Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) satellite observation pixel ( $33\times 33$  km). We present an analysis of the sensitivity and accuracy of SMAP SM products in a boreal forest environment over a two-year period in 2018 and 2019. Results show current SMAP radiometer-based L2 SM products have higher correlation with the in situ lower mineral layer SM than with the top organic layer, although the overall correlation is low. Correlations between in situ mineral layer SM and SMAP brightness-temperature (TB) products are higher than those observed with the SMAP SM product, suggesting current SMAP SM retrieval from the TB using the  $\tau $ – $\omega $  model introduces large uncertainties in the SM estimation, possibly from uncertain vegetation and surface parameters in the retrieval model. Results show SM can be retrieved using the  $\tau $ – $\omega $  model with reasonable accuracy over the boreal forest provided the vegetation and soil parameters are optimized.

In a prior work, we proposed a low-power and low-cost wildfire monitoring system based on distributed sensor networks. The system combined a camera with humidity and smoke sensors. A major challenge in the implementation of that system was to classify the difference between camera images with and without the fire/smoke. The latest developments in deep learning offer a viable solution to process the camera images and detect the presence of wildfire/smoke using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). We use a very large wildfire image database to train and validate the CNN classifiers and analyze their classification accuracy.

From the energy sec-tor that contribute most to global warming is the power generation sector. Currently there are still many power plants that use fossil fuels such as petroleum and coal as the main source of turbine drive in generating electrical energy. Renewable energy is capable of generating electrical energy without generating and increasing greenhouse gases. Current renewable energy utilization trends continue to increase which contributes to the birth of the smart grid concept.

It is based on numerical solution of Reynolds equations for chemical components and equations of energy conservation for gaseous and condensed phases. It is assumed that the forest during a forest fire can be modeled as a two-temperature multiphase non-deformable porous reactive medium.

In most cases, the paralyzed communication system often appears as one of the factors which delays the disaster response and complicates the rescue operation.

Hence there is a need for an improved emergency communication system (ECS) to provide reliability and improve system performance during emergency.

It may be averted if a comprehensive system is installed in forest regions to detect fires and inform firefighting authorities to take timely action. The goal of this project is to create an Internet of Things (IoT)-based real-time detection system that detects fires and sends emergency notices to authorities. A GSM/GPRS module interacts with an IoT server because network bandwidth is typically very poor or nonexistent in forest regions. As a result, a 2G network is ideal for communicating with the server. A real-time fire monitoring system that differentiates fire and smoke is used to identify an actual fire occurrence. The nano-based Atmega328 IoT gateway identifies the forest’s fire as soon as possible and acts rapidly before it spreads across a large area. Here, this uses machine learning algorithms to detect the event of a fire in a large region. The system uses a flame sensor to detect the flame and a temperature sensor to measure the temperature in a particular area. By using the machine learning method, the system can easily give the result with actual detection and intimate the authority about the temperature condition. The data are then sent to the cloud-based application. In the event of an unusual rise in forest temperature, this will alert the forest authorities and sound the fire alarm. It can also predict future fires by using machine learning. This is accomplished using the fog computing method. Due of the sensors’ efficiency, this might potentially be applied in industrial settings. Any type of forest can make use of it. From this experiment, this research study deduced that it has a remarkable accuracy of 98% in predicting forest fires.

The primary threat is forest fires, which have disastrous repercussions. As a result, it is critical to identify and extinguish a fire before it spreads and destroys resources. To that end, we propose a forest fire detection and fighting mechanism using wireless sensor and actor networks (WSANs). Temperature sensors are utilized to detect fires, and actors (robots) are employed to extinguish them. Sensors and robots are distributed at random throughout the forest, forming clusters. Clustering, sleep/active scheduling for the sensors, and energy harvesting (EH)/moving modes for the robots, are used to extend and maximize the sensors/robots lifetime in the WSAN. In such a network, robots should move to the fire site as quickly as possible. To do this, we further propose a robot routing mechanism that focuses on determining the shortest path for each firefighting robot. In particular, each firefighting robot equipped with on-board processing uses a fuzzy  $Q$ -learning (FQL)-based trajectory mechanism to learn the shortest path to the fire zone in the least amount of time. Simulations are conducted to demonstrate the benefits of employing the proposed framework for rapid and effective fire response. When compared to the traditional  $Q$ -learning, the total approaching rate (a measure of how quickly the firefighting robots can reach the fire) to the fire spot is greater when utilizing the proposed FQL-based strategy.",2327-4662,,10.1109/JIOT.2023.3235998,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10014987,Environmental monitoring;fire detection and extinguishing;firefighting robot;reinforcement learning (RL);wireless sensor and actor networks (WSANs),Robot sensing systems;Robots;Forestry;Wireless sensor networks;Task analysis;Wireless communication;Satellites,,5.0,,68.0,IEEE,11-Jan-23,,,IEEE,IEEE Journals,"['wireless sensor networks', 'simulation']",['weather data'],[]

The present study has disentangled the contribution of different environmental and anthropogenic factors in forest fire over the western Himalayan (Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh) fire regime, which is an active fire hotspot in India. Fire-CCI v5.1 data was used to labelled fire and non-fire pixel. The climatic (e.g. maximum and minimum temperature, precipitation, solar radiation, vapour pressure, wind speed, water vapour deficit, soil moisture and palmer drought index), physiographic (elevation, slope, aspect and roughness), anthropogenic (population density and human modification) and locational (latitude and longitude) variables were utilized to unfold their contribution in forest fire by the aid of Random Forest (RF) a machine learning technique. After parameterization, a 10-fold cross-validation RF model was built over the whole dataset and the average overall accuracy, precision, recall, F-1 score and overall accuracy were estimated as 0.94 (±0.002), 0.86 (±0.003), 0.91 (±0.002) and 0.91 (±0.002), respectively. Furthermore, the whole dataset (2005-2018) was divided into two parts, training set (2005-2017) and testing (2018), to get a robust model. The testing accuracy (overall accuracy = 0.82, precision =0.79, recall = 0.95, F1 score = 0.86 and area under curve (AUC) = 0.95) suggested a reliable performance of RF model in forest fire classification (fire and non-fire). The contributions of the selected variables were retrieved from the feature importance of the RF model.

The forest fire plays an important role in everyone’s lives and also in our environment. Forest fire is an integral part of many ecosystems such as grassland, temperate forest etc. The ability to predict the area where the forest fire may occur will help in optimizing the situation. The paper presented the prediction of forest fire risk with the help of a machine learning algorithm by using meteorological data. From the existing literature and Limitations, we can show that Different studies have shown the amount of burnt area due to the forest fire, and many have proposed different models to predict forest fire. But there is no such literature which predicts the depth of risk for this forest fire specifically. For that reason, the objective of this work is to predict the risk of forest fire by identifying the particular area as highly prone, moderately prone, low prone and no fire prone area. As a Present Research, in this paper we have worked with different classification models to check which models work best to predict forest fire with greater accuracy. The results we have obtained with the help of various classifiers in machine learning are much better and reliable than the results obtained by traditional computing methods. Thus, this paper indicates a deeper investigation in the field of predicting forest fire risk through machine learning. As a contribution, in this paper we have used SVM, KNN, Decision Tree, Naive Bayes classifier for prediction purposes.

This prediction is used to find a safe route for the animals to move away and get to a safe zone. Then the animals are manipulated to move away from the wildfire with the help of distressing sounds produced from the speaker triggering their flight response for their self-preservation.

Experimental results on satellite derived land surface time-series demonstrate that directly operating with the quantized measurements, rather than treating them as real values, results in a low recovery error, while the proposed method is also capable of detecting temperature anomalies (e.g., forest fires).",2379-190X,978-1-5090-6631-5,10.1109/ICASSP40776.2020.9053151,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9053151,Tensors;Robust PCA;Quantization;Missing values;Image time-series,Temperature measurement;Tensors;Satellites;Quantization (signal);Signal processing algorithms;Surface treatment;Principal component analysis,,3.0,,16.0,IEEE,09-Apr-20,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,['remote sensing'],['weather data'],[]

Disaster is an activity, which can occur anytime and anywhere without prior information, which affects the whole mankind, human, animal and their prosperity. Since, disaster is a natural activity, no one can stop it, but a system can be developed to alert the people before the occurrence, so that many lives can be saved. The focus of this paper is towards utilizing the sensor network and LEACH algorithm for the development of an alert system, which works on the temperature.

Hence, the AC/DC breakdown characteristics study of the simulation transmission line gap in the flame conditions has an important meanning for the transmission lines' construction and safety operation. Gap breakdown in forest fire relates to many factors, such as flame temperature, conductivity and particles. Different vegetation's combustion characteristics determine that the discharge characteristics of the gap under the fire conditions are different. In order to research the breakdown characteristics of transmission lines gap under the vegetation flames (fir, straw and reed), the AC and DC breakdown characteristics tests were performed in a simulation test platform. Experimental results show that, the gap's insulation strength in the flames decreases significantly. As the gap is full bridged by the flame, the order of gap breakdown voltage under different vegetation is: fir branch<;straw<;reed<;fir trunk. Under the fir branch fire, the AC breakdown voltage of gap is reduced to about 10% of that in the air gap, and which is reduced to about 20% under the fir trunk. Gap breakdown has an evident effect of polarity characteristic under DC voltage, and the breakdown voltage of positive polarity is smaller than that of negative polarity. When the conductor-plate gap is enveloped by the flame, the breakdown voltage has a linear changed trend with the gap distance under the vegetation flames.

The indices are based on satellite measurements and they have been built using the hyperspectral infrared sensor IASI (Infrared Atmospheric Sounder Interfemoter) flying onboard the European Meteorological Platforms (MetOp). With the IASI instrument, we can retrieve simultaneously the surface emissivity and temperature, and thermo-dynamical parameters of air, such as temperature and water vapor mixing ratio profiles. Infrared surface emissivity (ε) is more closely related to surface type and coverage concerning the commonly used normalized differential vegetation index (or NDVI). By properly using surface emissivity in the infrared we defined a set of channels that are particularly sensitive to bare soil, green and senescent vegetation. IASI capability to sense the thermodynamic state of the atmosphere enables to retrieve both surface temperature (Ts) and dew point temperature (Td) close to the surface. The difference between these two quantities (Ts-Ts) is a direct measure of the hydric stress at the surface. Emissivity indices complemented with the last one, obtained from the same measurements, enable the individuating region to be subject to a risk of drought, hence and forest fire, and allow us to overcome the problem of lacking space and temporal consistency.

Using a quasi second-order stochastic dominance (Q-SSD) measure, this article proposes an optimization model to generate an optimal PSPS plan which mitigates the risk of costly wildfires while keeping the intentional power outages minimal. This objective is achieved by the strategic deployment of transportable energy backup technologies in the DS, i.e., mobile power sources (MPSs).

Sentinel-2 Multi-Spectral Instrument (MSI) is comprised of visible spectral bands, near infrared (NIR), and short wave infrared (SWIR) spectral bands. These spectral bands, band 8A (865 nm), band 11 (at 1.61 μm), and band 12 (at 2.19 μm), are employed to roughly approximate the temperature within the forest fire range (400 - 1500°C) using Planck's blackbody radiation law. The Normalised Difference Indices (NDI) of band 11 with 8A and band 12 with 11 are formulated, namely NDI1 and NDI2, respectively. The criteria of NDI1, NDI2, and band 12 ranges are estimated empirically to identify forest fire area into four thermal anomaly levels, i.e., high-temperature crown fire, typical crown fire, surface fire or smoldering area and remains of the fire. For the high-temperature crown fire area, band 12 value is very high, all indices are positive, and the NDI2 is lower than NDI1, following Planck's curve for temperature higher than 1200 K. For the typical crown fire area, the band 12 value is high, and the NDI2 can be higher than NDI1. For the smolder area, the band 12 value is in the middle range, and the NDI2 must be larger than 0.2. Finally, for remains area, the band 12 value is in the lower range, and NDI1 must be higher than -0.27.

Over the past few decades, there is substantial improvement in the computing power of computers and a decrease in the cost of image sensors, enabling video-based fire detection technology for real-time applications. The ability to differentiate between fire and non-fire threats is improved with the development of the Internet of Things (IoT) or Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN).

In particular, missing or inaccurate data can occur in certain regions or during extreme weather events. Therefore, a Convolutional Neural Network-Long Short-Term Memory (CNN-LSTM) based algorithm is proposed to improve the accuracy and reduce the prediction time in the outage region. Ground-based automated weather observatories are used to obtain real-time weather data, including extreme weather data. These data are pre-processed to enhance data quality and accuracy by removing duplicates, filling in missing values, handling anomalies, normalizing input variables, and reducing dimensionality. Based on the results of the data pre-processing, the outage rate was calculated for different types of meteorological disasters and the geographical characteristics of the outages were analyzed. This analysis provides insights into the impact of different types of meteorological disasters on power outages and helps improve the accuracy of predictive models. The proposed algorithm employs a CNN neural network to capture spatial and temporal information from raw meteorological data by stacking convolution and pooling layers. The extracted features are then organized and output by fully connected layers, laying the foundation for subsequent time series modeling. An LSTM network is further utilized to construct a prediction model for the outage area, which takes as input the feature extraction results of the meteorological data. By integrating the temporal dimension information of meteorological data, the model outputs accurate predictions for the outage area. The experimental results demonstrate a consistent outcome with the actual test results, achieving high prediction accuracy with a short prediction time of 4.3 s and a maximum non-outage detection rate of 2%.

Wildfire is one of the most common hazards and natural threats to biodiversity, disturbing the ecology and environment of a region. Natural causes such as lightning and man-made causes are significant sources of forest fires. If the wildfire goes unnoticed, it cannot be controlled quickly, and hence the impact of these disastrous effects can result in massive damage to human properties and areas of vegetation.

The conclusion of this paper through case study is: firstly, global warming and changes in local precipitation and other factors will provide conditions for the spread of forest fires, increasing the number of wildfires in the forest. Secondly, bark beetles will produce more fuel. They also reduce the availability of forest logs and limit the development of logging. Thirdly, uncontrollable forest fires will destroy forests and nearby infrastructure and increase recovery costs. Fourthly, reducing forest areas will destroy carbon sinks. Fifthly, the particles produced by forest fires will cause severe heart and lung diseases in the human body. Finally, this paper summarizes four solutions to forest fires. Forest Fire Suppression Through Artificial intelligence, Bark Beetle Removal Solution and Climate Change Technological Solution. In the Artificial Intelligence solution part, Support vector machine (SVM) and random forest were used to analyze four groups of different characteristics, distribution space, time, climate index and FWI system index.

First, the location of the source of the wildfire can be well located by information fusion between UAV and satellite, and the road conditions in the vicinity of the fire can be assessed and analyzed using multichannel remote sensing data. Second, the road network can be extracted and segmented in real time using UAV vision technology, and each road in the road network map can be given priority based on the results of road condition classification. Third, the spread model of dynamic fires calculates the new location of the fire source based on the fire intensity, wind speed and direction, and the radius increases as the wildfire spreads. Smoke is generated around the fire source to create a visual representation of a burning fire. Finally, based on the improved A* algorithm, which considers all the above factors, the UAV can quickly plan an escape route based on the starting and destination locations that avoid the location of the fire source and the area where it is spreading.

A 72 cm × 47 cm rectangular brick burning area prepared with Eucalypt ground litter was equipped with four K-type thermocouples at different heights to measure flame temperatures, which ranged from 283-865 K.

It is imperative to monitor fire conditions closely; otherwise, this may result in numerous property and human losses. One of the essential and significant uses of IoT is fire detection and fire hazard prevention. It can identify fires early and notify fire control centers. This paper proposes a smart fire detection and control system that uses temperature, smoke, flame, LDR, and MQ2 sensors to determine the fire's speed and intensity. In addition to transmitting the most recent situational information, this proposed Internet of Things-based fire monitoring and control system also takes the required corrective action.

It is an inexpensive application. It contains small, less energy-consuming, lower-cost devices combined with restricted computation, observation, and radio transmission capacities. People nowadays use fire alarms with sensors to detect fires. Fire sensors are unreliable. With the fast growth of WSNs, people can now remotely watch their surroundings to ascertain the current status. A standard fire alarm system is only able to detect one of the environmental parameters at a time. It is possible that there is a fire if the detection value is greater than the threshold; this would indicate that there is a fire. Copper, insulated, or cables are used to make the connections between detectors and alarms in a traditional fire alarm system. Due to the presence of a large number of elements at the site of the fire, the smoke alarm system will be unable to make an accurate determination as to the location of the flames. This article proposes a cognitive fire alert framework (CFAF) for realizing fire in unfriendly environments using WSN. It has a phase for wireless transmission, a phase for cognitive fire recognition, and a phase for the Random Forest Method (RFM).

Zhang,"Hubei Engineering Research Center for Safety Monitoring of New Energy and Power Grid Equipment, Hubei University of Technology, Wuhan, China; Hubei Engineering Research Center for Safety Monitoring of New Energy and Power Grid Equipment, Hubei University of Technology, Wuhan, China",IEEE Transactions on Plasma Science,21-Aug-23,2023,51,7.0,1974,1987,"This article mainly analyzes the effects of flame temperature, flame conductivity, and particles on the gap breakdown characteristics. Under high-temperature conditions, it can quickly increase the number of electrons and ions in the channel, increase the conductivity of the channel, and significantly enhance the thermal dissociation in the air near the electrode, resulting in a decrease in the breakdown voltage of the gap. Due to the effects of thermal dissociation and chemical ionization, there are a large number of charged particles in the flame, which makes the flame conductivity sufficiently high, provides sufficient current, promotes the development of discharge, and ultimately forms a stable discharge channel, leading to gap breakdown. After particles enter the gap, the electric field near the particles undergoes distortion. As the voltage increases, more and more particles are attracted, forming particle chains to bridge more gaps, ultimately leading to a significant decrease in the insulation strength of the gaps. Among them, the influence of flame conductivity is analyzed from four aspects: the source of charge, the characteristics of flame leakage current, the influence of conductivity on breakdown voltage, and the influence mechanism of conductivity on gap discharge. The discharge mechanism of the transmission lines under the condition of forest fire is described. Based on the similar characteristics of gas discharge and the on- site statistical analysis data of transmission lines under the conditions of forest fire, the breakdown mechanism of transmission lines under the conditions of forest fire is analyzed. First, the mechanism of gap discharge development under the conditions of forest fire is analyzed, and then, the breakdown model of transmission lines under the conditions of forest fire is analyzed by combining the line and forest fire parameters, According to the simulation test results (full-flame and semiflame test data), the average breakdown field strengths of fir branches, reeds, and straw in the flame zone are 24, 55, and 43 kV/m, while the average breakdown field strengths in the semiflame zone are 155, 160, and 150 kV/m, respectively. The mechanism of the influence of flame temperature, flame conductivity, and ash and smoke on the development of discharge in flames has been clarified. When a forest fire occurs, due to the high intensity of flame combustion, the thermal buoyancy and electric field will cause the ash particles generated by the combustion to float up and randomly suspend in the flame, triggering discharge near the high-voltage electrode, thereby reducing the insulation strength of the gap. The main impact of ash on the gap breakdown voltage is the “multiplication effect” of ash-triggered discharge. The strength of particles triggering discharge in flames is related to factors such as particle size and the proportion of bridging gaps. When the gap between the flames is not fully bridged, the safe distance between the 220-kV line and the flame body is calculated to be 1.83 m, which explains why combustible vegetation, such as straw and reeds, although their combustion height is not fully bridged, still causes the transmission line to trip. The breakdown voltage prediction formula proposed in this article can provide a certain reference for the management and logging of vegetation in transmission line corridors.",1939-9375,,10.1109/TPS.2023.3288352,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10174860,Chemical ionization;discharge mechanism;flame conductivity;flame temperature;forest fire;gap breakdown;leakage current;multiplication effect;particles;thermal dissociation,Fires;Electric breakdown;Forestry;Power transmission lines;Discharges (electric);Temperature;Conductivity,,1.0,,36.0,IEEE,06-Jul-23,,,IEEE,IEEE Journals,['simulation'],['weather data'],[]

The forecasting of wind power is a challenging task due to the variability of wind speed, wind direction, and other meteorological variables that affect wind power generation. The temporal relationships and trends contained in the data are implemented using time series models, such as autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA)and to identify the seasonal component, a seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average with X lag (SARIMAX) model has been implemented. Additionally, in order to take advantage of the complex linkages and non-linear patterns in the dataset, we use machine learning models like Multilinear regression, Decision tree regression and ensemble learning models such as Random Forest regression, and xGBoost.

The impact of this phenomenon includes human losses, environmental damage and high economic costs. To mitigate these effects, several computer simulation systems have been developed in order to predict fire behavior based on a set of input parameters, also called a scenario (wind speed and direction; temperature; etc.). However, the results of a simulation usually have a high degree of error due to the uncertainty in the values of some variables, because they are not known, or because their measurement may be imprecise, erroneous, or impossible to perform in real time. Previous works have proposed the combination of multiple results in order to reduce this uncertainty. State-of-the-art methods are based on parallel optimization strategies that use a fitness function to guide the search among all possible scenarios. Although these methods have shown improvements in the quality of predictions, they have some limitations related to the algorithms used for the selection of scenarios. To overcome these limitations, in this work we propose to apply the Novelty Search paradigm, which replaces the objective function by a measure of the novelty of the solutions found, which allows the search to continuously generate solutions with behaviors that differ from one another. This approach avoids local optima and may be able to find useful solutions that would be difficult or impossible to find by other algorithms.

By setting different scenarios of pure air gap, nonbridged and bridged gaps by ethanol flames, the breakdown voltage, average breakdown strength, and leakage current with various gap spacings are measured and analyzed. Results show that the flame centerline positions at a height of 4.0–6.0 cm are regarded as the main reaction zone. The breakdown processes of rod–plane gaps in ethanol flames are the combined results of diverse discharge patterns. Compared with the pure air case, the breakdown voltages are decreased by 27.8%–70.5% in the nonbridged gap and by 68.3%–77.1% in the bridged gap by ethanol flames, and their corresponding levels of average breakdown strengths decrease to 45.7% and 27.6%, respectively.

To protect and save the forest, there is not enough data for researchers to understand the change of the micro-climate and how it's affecting its fauna and flora. Moreover, to understand how the coal-fired power plant is affecting this forest, the forest has to be constantly monitored.

A 6 MW fire source is prescribed in a compartment on the first floor with the window confronting the incoming air flow. Windward and leeward wind conditions are designed to examine the influential aspects of wind. Two parallel stairwells separated by a corridor are located at the center of the apartment and allow the smoke to spread to the upper floors. Several important parameters featuring the smoke propagation characteristics, including the smoke temperature, CO concentration and visibility in fire compartment, corridor, stairwells and upper layers, are recorded by the preset monitoring points and snapshots of the simulation results. An analytical model is employed to estimate the break time of window at 380 °C tolerance temperature, which is utilized subsequently in the numerical simulations to determine the onset of wind intervention. The results show that the leeward condition has negligible effect on the smoke evolution in the computation domain compared with the results of no-wind cases. However, in windward conditions the wind velocity has significant influence on the interested parameters and little smoke flows out form the broken window. The smoke spread rate and visibility inside the building are positively and negatively correlated with the wind velocity, respectively. The wind velocity affects the smoke temperature slightly, but greatly affects the temperature in the corridor, the opposite room and stairwell. The smoke spread in stairwell takes less than 1 minute due to the strong buoyancy, suggesting sever hazard in practical accident. The CO concentrations in all the cases shows similar trend to that of smoke temperature at each monitoring points, and the CO concentration level is much higher than the critical value for human safety, 500 ppm.",,978-1-7281-5322-3,10.1109/ICFSFPE48751.2019.9055824,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9055824,high-rise building;FDS;environmental wind;smoke temperature;CO concentration,,,1.0,,18.0,IEEE,06-Apr-20,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,['simulation'],['weather data'],[]

It is caused by the accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, including carbon dioxide and methane. Although, in terms of the volume, methane is considered secondary to carbon dioxide, it is about 21 times more damaging when compared over a 100-year period. Fugitive methane emissions from underground coal mines significantly contribute to global warming. Amongst all the known methods to reduce the fugitive methane, application of thermal oxidation (or, simply, burning) is deemed the most effective and practical. This process produces water vapour and carbon dioxide, which has significantly lower adverse impact on the atmosphere than methane. The thermal oxidisers operate at high temperatures, which may introduce a risk of fire and explosion to the mine. In order to mitigate such risk, a thorough understanding of the methane explosion characteristics is essential. Methane fire and explosion experiments under conditions pertinent to underground coal mines are expensive, risky and necessitate significant effort, and thus require enormous preparation and safety procedures. It is cheaper and safer to analyse existing data to discover patterns and predict explosions than to conduct new extensive experiments.

The people who involve themselves in the same risk their lives in order to save the lives of the victims. In such cases, tracking a person in case of dense areas can be of huge difficulty as GPS signal will not be in a position to penetrate through the buildings. They have the chance of getting reflected back, thereby leading to erroneous prediction of the location of the person. It would be handy to develop a wearable that can help in tracking the person. This can be of great use during rescue operations in forests. JARVIS is the device that we have developed, which is a personalized monitoring system to track the person in case if the place has no access to GPS using an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU). The IMU sensor has accelerometer, gyrometer and magnetometer which can be used to estimate the route. Pedestrian Dead Reckoning algorithm and Zero Velocity Update algorithm have been used in order to find the position of a person relative to the initial position that can be fixed. We estimate the position of the person with an accuracy of 50 cm. Moreover, it becomes essential to predict the state of a person who is involved in rescue missions as the life of the person is at huge risk. Hence, the activity of a person is being recognized using Machine learning in real-time and is sent to a server. In addition to the above mentioned features, we use pulse sensor and temperature sensor in order to track the health condition of a person so that we get information about the condition of the person so that first aid can be given in case of emergency. This can be used in various rescue missions such as fire rescue operations and military operations where the person who is involved in rescue mission needs to be monitored so that effective first aid can be given to him promptly in case of unexpected body state of the person.

Fragility functions are essential tools for probabilistic risk assessment to estimate the failure likelihood of the system components as a function of hazard intensity. Widely exposed to the environment and atmospheric stressors, overhead power line conductors are among the most susceptible electric delivery infrastructure to approaching wildfires. Beyond the state-of-the-art fragility models, this article proposes novel parameterized wildfire fragility functions that can capture the impact of different environmental conditions and wildfire severity measures on overhead power line conductors. In doing so, wildfire behaviour is comprehensively characterized in order to model the temperature change in overhead conductors in the face of progressing wildfires. A novel parametric fragility model, which is a function of a set of physical and environmental features (e.g., conductor height, landscape slope, the dryness of fuel, fuel depth, wind speed, flame length), is then suggested to assess the failure likelihood of conductors given a permissible safety conductor temperature rise. A set of fire features (e.g., fire line intensity, fire rate of spread, and the angle of the fire approaching the conductors) is embedded in the proposed fragility model to capture the wildfire uncertainties. The numerical results reveal that, unlike the commonly-used fragility models, the proposed parameterized fragility function is able to accurately represent the impact of critical physical, environmental, and fire features in determining the vulnerability of power distribution lines when facing wildfire emergencies.",1558-0679,,10.1109/TPWRS.2023.3298769,"National Science Foundation(grant numbers:ECCS-2114100,RISE-2022505,RISE-2220626);",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10193805,Wildfire hazards;parameterized fragility functions;risk assessment;power distribution systems;overhead power line conductors,Fires;Conductors;Wind speed;Heating systems;Fuels;Convection;Mathematical models,,1.0,,40.0,IEEE,25-Jul-23,,,IEEE,IEEE Journals,[],['weather data'],[]

This paper focuses on wildfires that occurred in Sono1ma County for model development training and testing purposes.

Simulators implementing forest fire spread models require several input parameters to deliver their predictions. Wind speed and direction are sensitive parameters that are usually obtained at low resolution (some kilometers). It is necessary to couple a wind field model, that generates a wind field at high resolution (for example, 30 meters). Even in this case of coupled wind field model-forest fire spread simulator, several parameters include a high degree of uncertainty and usually must be calibrated. One of the strategies consists to introduce a Genetic Algorithm (GA) to calibrate the input parameters according to the actual evolution of the fire. GAs are based on running large amount of simulations, and evaluating and comparing the results provided by each simulation. This fact emphasizes how critical are the metrics used to assess the error of the computational forecasts.

443,Topological Data Analysis of Fire Prone Weather Conditions in California,H. Kim,,2019 IEEE Integrated STEM Education Conference (ISEC),24-Oct-19,2019,,,3,3,"The recent drought trend in California poses multiple threats to the United States economy and security and also increases the risk of wildfires. Wildfires cause serious air quality issues during the dry seasons and increase the number of mudslides in the subsequent rainy seasons. Frequent and severe wildfires are often correlated with abnormally warm and dry climates. However, this relationship is not linear, which means that there are other factors potentially influencing these fires. The objective of this study is to use topological data analysis (TDA) to detect and classify nonlinear patterns in weather data. In order to examine the fire-prone summer weather in California, TDA is applied to various weather variables, including temperature, relative humidity, and precipitation. The five most and least intense fire seasons in California, both in the summer and winter, are chosen to compare the frequency of fires and the burned area data, taken from the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. Various pairs of two weather variables, e.g. temperature and humidity, are analyzed. Using the TDA package in R the Kernel distance, persistence diagrams, and barcode graphs are compared between the active and inactive fire seasons. This study will discuss the similarities and differences between active and inactive fire seasons based on these TDA results.",2330-331X,978-1-7281-1502-3,10.1109/ISECon.2019.8881997,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8881997,,Fires;Data analysis;Humidity;Conferences;Market research;Security,,,,0.0,IEEE,24-Oct-19,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,[],['weather data'],['USA']

The cause of forest fires is caused by two factors, namely natural and human. Indicators of forest fires can be known from the appearance of hotspots or hot spots. A hotspot is an indicator of an area that has a relatively higher surface temperature than the surrounding surface temperature that has been detected by Terra / Aqua satellites with a MODIS sensor. Furthermore, the hotspots are not only randomly distributed but also clustered. The research related to the identification process of hotspot distribution patterns in an area in Sulawesi is still limited and has its novelty.

The ground surface parameters including surface roughness, moisture, and dielectric constant could be derived by SAR backscattering data. However, estimating thermal properties of ground surface based on SAR remote sensing is complicated because of sensor operation in microwave region. Meanwhile, the thermal properties of ground surface are crucial for estimating surface temperature originated from natural or anthropogenic sources such volcanic activity, urban area, forest fire, or steam spots. To identify the thermal signature from the SAR data, we performed laboratory experiments by incorporating thermal property of materials to be derived from SAR parameters. The experiments were performed by heating ground surface materials including altered rocks from geothermal field and peats from dense vegetation field. We measured moisture, electric potential, magnetic susceptibility, and permeability of the samples with variation of temperature. The measured temperature was controlled by thermal camera FLIR C2 and ground thermometer FLUKE 52 up to 250°C. According to the measurement, we identified that the moisture and electric potential of materials are decrease significantly at temperature more than 100°C. An interesting phenomenon could be reported that the magnetic susceptibility and permeability response to the altered rock and peat samples temperature similarly. The increasing temperature leads to decrease magnetic susceptibility and permeability in general. The mineral and organic content of the rocks and peats controlled their magnetic properties.

We adopt an encoder-classifier architecture: the BiLSTM-attention-based encoder is trained with supervised contrastive learning, while the fully-connected classifier is optimized against a weighted loss for increased recall. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed model is robust to spatial and temporal variations in occurrence of fires, thereby making its deployment possible in any region of the world.

Precise location identification of coal fire burning is vital for disaster management. Traditional methods of identifying fire zones focus on specific indicators, such as temperature anomalies. However, solely relying on one indicator can easily lead to “heterogeneous homogeneity,” and using multiple indicators complicates threshold settings. To address this, this article presents an enhanced ensemble learning model named AdaBoost_RF_StBP for coal fire zone identification. By integrating multimodal remote sensing data, we extracted diverse abnormal features of fire zones. Using a standard deviation ellipse, we categorized feature samples into three fire zone types, which were then analyzed using the proposed model. The combined approach of base and metalearners was applied in coal fire zones located in Jiangjun Gobi, Jiangjun Temple, Sandaoba, and Beishan coal mines. Results show that the multimodal remote sensing data coupled by our model can effectively addresses the “heterogeneous homogeneity” issue. The accuracy of the model in terms of accuracy, precision, recall rate, F1_score, etc., has been improved from 0.56 to 0.87 of the initial base-learners to 0.8–0.96 of the metalearners.

Current fire detection methods primarily rely on traditional physical sensors such as light, smoke, and temperature detectors, which often struggle in complex environments. The susceptibility of existing fire detection technologies to background interference frequently results in false alarms, missed detections, and low detection accuracy. To address these issues, this paper proposes a fire detection algorithm based on an improved YOLOv8 model. First, to enhance the detection capabilities for large-scale fire and smoke targets, a large target detection head is added to the backbone of the YOLOv8 model. This modification enhances the network’s receptive field, allowing it to capture a broader range of contextual information and identify fires over extensive areas. Secondly, an efficient multi-scale attention mechanism, EMA (Efficient Multi-Scale Attention Module), based on cross-space learning is integrated into the FPN (Feature Pyramid Network) part of the model. This mechanism highlights target features while suppressing background interference. Additionally, a PAN-Bag (Path Aggregation Network Bag) structure is proposed to help the model more accurately detect objects such as fire and smoke, which have uneven feature distributions and variable morphologies. With these improvements, we introduce the YOLOv8-FEP algorithm, which offers higher detection accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that the YOLOv8-FEP algorithm improves the mAP by 3.1% and the accuracy by 5.8% compared to the original YOLOv8 algorithm, proving the effectiveness of the enhanced algorithm.",2169-3536,,10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3448608,Liaoning Provincial Department of Education Youth Project for Research on Record Linking Technology Based on Privacy Protection(grant numbers:LJKQZ20222440);,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10644114,Fire detection;YOLOv8;EMA;PAN-Bag,Feature extraction;Accuracy;YOLO;Detection algorithms;Convolutional neural networks;Forestry;Attention mechanisms,,,,27.0,CCBYNCND,23-Aug-24,,,IEEE,IEEE Journals,['wireless sensor networks'],['weather data'],['Global']

Due to the high resistance and low grounding current associated with tree contact faults, traditional protective devices often fail to detect and trigger at the appropriate threshold levels. However, the presence of undetected tree contact faults for extended periods can lead to dangerous situations, such as the outbreak of wildfires. Existing high-resistance fault models are inadequate in reflecting the mechanisms of tree contact and accurately identifying such faults. This research addresses these limitations by analyzing the physical mechanisms underlying tree contact and developing an improved modeling approach for identifying these faults. The modeling approach considers various factors such as arc characteristics, the influence of temperature on conductivity, and the impact of tree trunk moisture on conductivity. By incorporating these factors into the fault model, a more comprehensive representation of the fault mechanism is achieved. The process of tree contact is divided into multiple stages, and equivalent models are constructed based on the actual physical processes involved. Through comparative analysis with real waveform data, it is demonstrated that the proposed fault models effectively capture the evolutionary process of tree contact faults.

This versatile primitive is applicable in the physical security domain (e.g., detecting intruders in an area) or for disaster preemption, such as detecting ignition events of forest fires. Prior systems implemented this primitive over large areas by deploying a network of sensor devices, which detect changes in a specific physical parameter like pressure or temperature induced by a target. However, these systems are not designed for use in adverse environments where one or more sensors can behave in a faulty manner. While many algorithms in the distributed systems literature can be naively used to implement target localization in a fault-tolerant manner, these approaches are energy-intensive as they use computationally expensive cryptographic operations not appropriate for resource-constrained sensors. We present SENSORBFT, an energy-efficient, fault-tolerant approach for target localization. SENSORBFT uses a novel asynchronous approximate agreement protocol that enables correct sensors to achieve an approximate consensus in the presence of faulty sensors. Sensors fulfill their energy budgets by tuning the precision and accuracy of localization, where precision is the difference between honest sensors' outputs and accuracy is the difference between an honest sensor's output and the target's true location. In optimal scenarios, this protocol reduces communication from $O$($n$3) to $O$($n$2) messages per round, where $n$ is the number of sensors sharing coverage over a piece of area.

In this paper, we propose a novel architecture that combines sensor, drone, blockchain, and machine learning technologies to support a long-term monitoring system for vast areas of land. Long-term monitoring is achieved by employing multigenerational sensors that have been deployed at the start but are woken up in stages as and when needed to replace or reinforce existing sensors. A swarm of drones periodically scans the landscape to identify areas that need immediate attention (e.g., dry soil, pests or insects, humidity, temperature, etc.). Drones store and process the data using onboard units and make real-time decisions regarding changing path plans or changing scanning frequencies. Optionally, data is sent to the base station that fuses the information from multiple drones in the swarm, and inputs the fused data to a machine-learning model that recommends the needed actions. The actions may include obtaining additional data, awakening more sensors, actions to handle any situation by signaling for external actions such as cloud seeding, controlled chemical spraying from a drone, etc., in agricultural applications.

In this study, the collision reaction between particles is comprehensively considered from the microscopic point of view. The rod-plate discharge model based on the hydrodynamic is used to explore the influence of environmental temperature and humidity changes on the generation, development, and evolution of discharge plasma particles and their effects on electron density, electric field intensity, streamer propagation rate, and streamer radius. The simulation results indicate that within the temperature range of 300–400 K and the relative humidity range of 20%–60%, there is a notable increase in streamer electron density and electric field intensity. However, at higher temperature and humidity levels, this increase results in a slight decrease in streamer electron density and electric field intensity. The streamer propagation velocity follows a three-stage pattern of “fast-slow-fast,” with a significant acceleration due to the increase in temperature and humidity. With rising temperatures, the streamer radius also expands. Similarly, within the relative humidity range of 20%–60%, the streamer radius increases as humidity levels rise, while excessive humidity reduces the channel’s radius.

Such simplification neglects the variability of h and ω over time, potentially compromising the accuracy of soil moisture estimates at the satellite footprint scale. This study aims to derive dynamic, pixel-scale h and ω parameters specifically for the SMAP single-channel algorithm (SCA) and the regularized dual-channel algorithm (RDCA). This is achieved through an iterative inverse procedure that minimizes the differences between the simulated brightness temperatures from spatially representative 9 km soil moisture and SMAP observations across the SMAP core validation sites. The results demonstrated that the incorporation of dynamic h and ω parameters, derived on a daily scale, markedly enhance the soil moisture retrieval performance with an average unbiased root mean square error (ubRMSE) of 0.01 (0.02) m³/m³ and Pearson Correlation (R) of 0.95 (0.90) for the SCA (RDCA) algorithms, indicating that dynamic parameterization holds significant promise for improving retrieval accuracy. The daily scale h parameters are generally above the static values utilized in the SMAP SCA. Within the SMAP SCA framework, the accuracy of soil moisture estimates employing daily scale h and ω parameters - randomly selected from the SCA range (h∊ [0.03, 0.16], and ω∊ [0, 0.08]) – demonstrates notable stability and is comparable to the SMAP level 3 product. Furthermore, the daily scale parameters were temporally contracted to generate a monthly climatology for h and ω. While soil moisture values derived from these climatological h and ω parameters exhibit reduced absolute bias, their ubRMSE and R slightly degrade relative to SMAP level 3 product. This degradation likely suggests that the climatological parameters' gradual variations are insufficient to capture the fluctuations of those daily parameters. Moreover, the static h and ω values for the RDCA are systematically higher than those for the SCA. However, there is no consistent trend in the magnitudes of dynamic h and ω between different algorithms. Identifying the most effective dynamic h and ω parameters within the SMAP algorithmic framework necessitates not only selecting an appropriate parameter range but also accurately tracking the temporal evolutions of surface roughness and vegetation scattering. Potential applications arising from improvements in retrieved soil moisture include the management of agricultural lands and forecasts of their productivity, quantification of global water and energy fluxes at the land surface, and management of forests, particularly in instances where disturbances such as droughts, floods, or wildfire are concerned.",2151-1535,,10.1109/JSTARS.2024.3457941,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10675324,L-band passive microwave;soil moisture;radiative transfer;remote sensing,Soil moisture;Heuristic algorithms;Brightness temperature;Vegetation mapping;Land surface;Surface roughness;Rough surfaces,,,,,CCBYNCND,10-Sep-24,,,IEEE,IEEE Early Access Articles,['remote sensing'],['weather data'],['Global']

The advantage of this methodology is that it is independent of system parameters, and that any future values of critically high temperature may be predicted before they occur, so that drivers can be alerted and take corrective measures before actual damage takes place. This methodology may be applied to prevent incidents of fire in EV batteries, energy wastage due to high temperatures during charging or normal running, and to enhance passenger comfort.",1939-9367,,10.1109/TIA.2024.3456753,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10670538,Regression;Machine Learning;Temperature Prediction;Random Forest;R-Square,Temperature sensors;Temperature measurement;Machine learning algorithms;Predictive models;Monitoring;Batteries;Prediction algorithms,,,,,IEEE,10-Sep-24,,,IEEE,IEEE Early Access Articles,['machine learning'],['weather data'],[]

In order to align such an application with the current trends in field of electrification, a project was developed to develop a hybrid solution. The requirements were based on the philosophy that during its operation, the funicular can recover a large quantity of energy during log’s downhill, as the system actually must operate as brake. Studies were engaged when decisioning on the chemistry, Li ion or Lead Acid. The latter one handshake well with operating cycles of a funicular as well as low temperature exposure in forest has less impact on the battery performances.

These substances can be transported seaward and deposited on the ocean surface. In this study, Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) images are used to map the relative smoke concentration over the ocean between November 8 and 11, 2018 from the recent California fires, with the ultimate goal of developing a generally applicable approach to map smokes over oceans. Because both biomass-burning smokes and clouds can produce strong backscattering signals, two key differences are used to separate them: 1) water-vapor absorption in certain wavelengths only occurs in clouds and 2) cumulus and cirrus clouds occur at different altitudes, therefore, bearing different thermal signatures. Based on these observations, a decision-tree method is developed to separate smokes from clouds. First, MODIS top-of-atmosphere (TOA) reflectance at 936 nm is used to detect both clouds and smokes over oceans. Then, brightness temperature derived from the 9730-nm band is used to separate cirrus from others. Finally, a water absorption depth (WAD) index is used to distinguish cumulus clouds from smokes, whose relative concentration in each image pixel is estimated from the MODIS TOA reflectance at 859 nm. Such derived smoke distribution and concentration are validated using concurrent Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite (CALIPSO) data, which provide the fine mode aerosol optical thickness (AOT) of smokes. Test of the approach over the recent Australia fires shows promising results, suggesting that the approach might be implemented by operational agencies to monitor and quantify smokes from biomass burning on a routine basis.",1558-0644,,10.1109/TGRS.2021.3084042,"National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:42071387,41771376);",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9449623,Australia fires;biomass-burning smoke;California fires;Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite (CALIPSO);Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS);spectral features,Clouds;MODIS;Oceans;Aerosols;Cloud computing;Instruments;Laser radar,,,,40.0,IEEE,09-Jun-21,,,IEEE,IEEE Journals,['remote sensing'],['weather data'],"['USA', 'Australia']"

The changes in occurrence and/or intensity of these events have been studied using climate simulations under two IPCC emission scenarios: RCP8.5 (business as usual) and RCP4.5 (corresponding roughly to the Nationally Determined Contributions following the Paris agreement). As expected for this time horizon, climate model uncertainty is larger than that linked to the emission scenario. No major changes are projected for storms, wet snow, and heavy rainfalls.

In 2011, in the San Gabriel Valley, 248 utility poles broke, causing an outage to 440,000 customers for up to a week. In 2018, a component on a transmission tower broke, igniting the Camp Fire, which destroyed 18,804 buildings and killed 85 civilians. The cause of these incidents can be ascribed, in part, to deficient methods in accurately capturing the probability that a given pole, conductor, or other component can withstand windy conditions without breaking. Existing software and methodology do not account for material strength variability or even calculate a possibility of failure based on known local wind speeds. The current research believes that it can correct these shortcomings by introducing a program - SafeBuild - that provides the probability that a structure can withstand any given wind gust. SafeBuild calculates the stress on poles and conductors using large deflection finite element analysis. SafeBuild calculates the probability of failure of any component using z-scores based on material median strengths and coefficients of variation.

Excessive vehicular emissions, stubble burning, fire and smoke emissions are some of the major causes. The overall quality of air impacts the health, growth and development of the people. Pollutants present in the air impact the air quality. In order to estimate the quality of air, an Air Quality Index (AQI) is computed. It is done using the concentration levels of the pollutants. Climate also plays a significant role where parameters such as temperature, Wind Speed (WS), Wind Direction (WD), Solar Radiation (SR), Barometric Pressure (BP) affect the quality of air. Earlier works considered only pollutant data to generate models for AQI estimation using machine learning approaches. A further study in the domain showed that terrain features also influence AQI. Thus, the proposed system derives terrain features for any given location. In addition, it considers a combination of pollutant and meteorological parameters to generate the air quality estimation model. Since AQI is a continuous value, regression approach is preferred for modeling. Analysis is performed in three stages, firstly only with pollutant information, secondly with pollutant and climate information and thirdly with pollutant, climate and terrain information.

Simulation scenarios were constructed to investigate the effect of methane concentration on the explosive properties of the freely dispersed vapor cloud. The premixed jet flame was ejected from a cuboid tube filled with varying concentrations of methane, and the mushroom shaped flame front was mainly attributed to the combustion of the ejected unburnt gas. The numerical simulations match the empirical and analytical formulas well, indicating the numerical model provides acceptable accuracy in assessing the explosion behaviors. The research results show that the methane concentration plays an important role in determining the jet flame length and temperature which reach respectively a peak value, 3.3 m, and a minimum value, 779.12K, at 11 % methane concentration.

Constant heat flux (HF) was employed and spontaneous ignition was studied. Finite thick, 3, 6 and 10 mm, 5 cm squared samples and six sets of airflow velocities 0 to 1.2 m/s were selected in the tests. Surface temperature and ignition time under the designed conditions were collected and compared with corresponding numerical simulation results, performed by ANSYS fluid dynamics simulator, which consider thermal decomposition in solid and thermal insulation layer. The results shown that the ignition temperature of PMMA is positively correlated with increasing airflow velocity, indicating the critical temperature is not a reliable ignition criterion in these scenarios. The airflow velocity has little effect on surface temperature. For airflow velocities larger than 0.4 m/s, the ignition time increases significantly with the increase of airflow velocity and sample thickness. While for 0.4 m/s airflow velocity, the ignition temperature is lowered and the ignition time is shortened.",,978-1-7281-5322-3,10.1109/ICFSFPE48751.2019.9055863,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9055863,forced convection airflow;surface temperature;ignition time;PMMA;ANSYS,,,,,32.0,IEEE,06-Apr-20,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences,['simulation'],['weather data'],[]

Meteorological indicators, commonly used in LFMC estimation, are often derived from reanalysis datasets of meteorological data. However, since air temperature is highly correlated with land surface temperature (LST), utilizing LST extracted from thermal infrared remote sensing data holds the potential to substitute air temperature in estimating LFMC and enhance accuracy.

JULES-INFERNO is a global vegetation and fire model simulating wildfire emissions and area burnt on a global scale. However, because of the high data dimensionality and system complexity, JULES-INFERNO's computational costs make it challenging to apply to fire risk forecasting with unseen initial conditions. Typically, running JULES-INFERNO for 30 years of prediction will take several hours on High Performance Computing (HPC) clusters. To tackle this bottleneck, two data-driven models are built in this work based on Deep Learning techniques to surrogate the JULES-INFERNO model and speed up global wildfire forecasting. More precisely, these machine learning models take global temperature, vegetation density, soil moisture and previous forecasts as inputs to predict the subsequent global area burnt on an iterative basis. Average Error per Pixel (AEP) and Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) are used as metrics to evaluate the performance of the proposed surrogate models. A fine tuning strategy is also proposed in this work to improve the algorithm performance for unseen scenarios. Numerical results show a strong performance of the proposed models, in terms of both computational efficiency (less than 20 seconds for 30 years of prediction on a laptop CPU) and prediction accuracy (with AEP under 0.3% and SSIM over 98% compared to the outputs of JULES-INFERNO).",2471-285X,,10.1109/TETCI.2024.3445450,"Leverhulme Centre for Wildfires, Environment and Society; Leverhulme Trust(grant numbers:RC-2018-023); French Agence Nationale de la Recherche(grant numbers:ANR-22-CPJ2-0143-01);",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10646384,ConvLSTM;machine learning;surrogate modelling;wildfire,Computational modeling;Predictive models;Mathematical models;Numerical models;Data models;Long short term memory;Atmospheric modeling,,,,,IEEE,26-Aug-24,,,IEEE,IEEE Early Access Articles,['machine learning'],['weather data'],['Global']

To analyze the insulation strength of transmission lines under vegetation fire conditions, it is necessary to calculate the nonuniform temperature rise sag accurately. In this paper, a vegetation fire temperature measurement platform was established to obtain the fire temperature of pinus yunnanensis at different heights. Taking a 400m span and LGJ-500/65 conductor as examples, the effects of different vegetation types, number of fire spots and wind on maximum sag were analyzed. The simulation results show that the sag obtained considering the non-nonuniform temperature rise is more accurate than the existing piecewise calculation results. The highest flame temperature of pinus yunnanensis is 829°C, and its maximum sag can reach 15.82m. When the length of the conductor affected by flame is unchanged, the increase in the number of fire spots has little influence on the sag, and the maximum increase is only 2.51%. Under the transverse wind, the vertical height of the flame will be significantly reduced, so that the temperature at the conductor will be reduced, and the sag of the conductor will be reduced.

The first problem to develop the intelligent control and optimization technology of the MSWI process is to establish the controlled object model. Thus, a data-driven model based on ensemble decision tree algorithm is constructed for the above-mentioned three controlled objects in this paper.
